@dataclass: Define Special Classes With Less Code
The @dataclass decorator (introduced in Python 3.7) can automatically generate several special methods for a class, such as __init__, __repr__, __eq__, __lt__, and so on.

Therefore, it can save us lots of time from writing these basic methods. If a class is primarily used to store data, the @dataclass decorator is our best friend.

To demonstrate, the following example just defines two data fields of a class named Point. Thanks to the @dataclass decorator, itâ€™s enough to be used:

from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Point:
    x: float
    y: float

point = Point(1.0, 2.0)
print(point)
# Point(x=1.0, y=2.0)
